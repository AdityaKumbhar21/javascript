Javascript is a dynamically typed language as we have no need to declare datatype before declaring the variable.

Datatypes: 
based on how data is stored in memory it is categorized in two types

Primitive :
String,Number,Boolean,null, undefined, Symbol,BigInt

Non-Primitive:
Array,Objects,Functions

*******************************Memory********************

Stack (Primitive):
it gives the copy of the value not the actual value

Heap(Non-Primitive):
It gives refrence of the original value,so as we change value original value gets affected
