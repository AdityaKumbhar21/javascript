Scopes 

Scope:
    {}

Local scope:
    Local scope also known as block scope is the scope in a block like function,conditional,loops
the variables declared in the block scope are accessible only in the block

e.g:
    if(true){
        let score = 10
        const score2 = 100
    }
    console.log(score) // this will give an error as the scope of score is only in the if block
    console.log(score2) // this will give an error as the scope of score2 is only in the if block

Global Scope:
    Global scope is where a variable declared can be accessible in the entire code
e.g:
// Here score and score2 are accessible inside and outside a if block as the are declared in global scope
    let score = 10
    const score2 = 100
    if(true){
    console.log(score) 
    console.log(score2)
    }
